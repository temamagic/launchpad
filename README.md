# Launchpad 

This is a simple launchpad in browser. It's inspired by [Novation Launchpad Intro](https://intro.novationmusic.com/)

## Features
- Drag'n'drop samples from your PC on pads
- Play sounds one at a time or simultaneously
- Preload samples
- Something will be here..

## Disclaimer
> I *DO NOT KNOW* JS or CSS, that's why there are a lot of "cratches" and "smelling" code. But this is open source, everything is in your hands

## How to
Open https://intro.novationmusic.com and here you go

Or, if you want to use it itself:
1. Download the repo
2. Add youre own samples to the `samples` folder (read readme in the folder)
3. ???
4. PROFIT
